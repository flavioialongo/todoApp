## What does the app do?
Just a simple To-do app. 

## What technologies did I use?
I just wanted to learn a bit more about JavaScript, React in particular. 
I also wanted to add a simple MongoDB database because I wanted to see hoe frontend and backend are connected. 
A simple authentication and authorization logic is implemented using JWT.
